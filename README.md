## What Is a RimWorld Cheat?

RimWorld cheats come in two forms:

* **Dev Mode** (built-in debug tools from the devs)
* **Mods/Trainers** that add cheat menus, godlike powers, and total map control

Both options give you **unlimited access** to build, heal, spawn, edit, destroy, and tweak **everything** — colonists, enemies, animals, weather, and more.
